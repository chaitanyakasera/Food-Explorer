MVI Pattern
==============

Model : Represent the data and logic
View : Displays UI Components
Intent : Captures user actions sent to View Model

Flow ->
======
Intent -> View Model -> Model update -> State Emission -> View Update

Advantage of MVI over MVVM :
===========================
Unidirectional flow : Easier data control in UI
Predictable state: Clear UI Behavior based on ViewModel responses.
Explicit User Actions: Intent Clarity for  UI Update
Testability Simple unit testing of flow components

When to Use MVI
=================

Complex UI Logic: Structured handlin g of intricate UI Interactions
Predictable UI State Clear UI state management from user actions.
Testability : Easy ZIsolation for UI Components and logic

Disadvantages of MVI
==============

Learning Curve: Steeper learning due to strict flow and new concepts
Boilerplate Code: some boilerplate needed like other architecture patterns
Overhead:
